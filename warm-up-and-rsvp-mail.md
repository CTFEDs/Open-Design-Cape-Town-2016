1. Who does accessibility, Universal Design, and Human-Centered Design help?
2. Who will you share the stuff from the workshop with?

When you reply to this message, we'll update your RSVP to Yes. If you don't reply to this message by 6pm on Wednesday 17th August, we'll update your RSVP to No. Eep!
