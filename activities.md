# Global Accessibility Awareness Day activities

See [Participate in Global Accessibility Awareness Day](http://www.globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/participate.html) for more detail.

* Go Mouseless / Trackpadless
  * Is there a visible focus indicator (i.e., do you know where you are) at all times as you navigate each screen using the tab and shift tab keys?
  * Are you able to interact with every element that receives focus using the keyboard alone?
  * If there is any element that provides functionality if you hover over it with your mouse, such as revealing a tooltip or a set of actions, can you display this strictly using the keyboard alone?

* Enlarge Your Fonts
  * Check that your page(s) is accessible and usable for low vision/visually impaired users.
  * Resize the text to 200 percent. Make sure there is no loss of content or functionality.
  * Have all elements resized, including all widgets?
* Check for Sufficient Color Contrast, and for Colour Blindness compatibility.

* Check Order of Elements
  * Check your Page(s) to make sure elements will be read by screen readers in the correct order.
  * Disable the page's stylesheets and compare the order of elements before and after.

* Surf The Web With A Screen Reader
  * There are a number of free/open source screen readers available for Windows users. One of the more popular ones is [NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA)](http://www.nvda-project.org/). Take a bit of time beforehand to download the software and learn some of NVDAâ€™s documented basic keystrokes.
  * Mac users, you have a built-in screen reader called [VoiceOver](http://www.apple.com/accessibility/voiceover/) on your systems. Take some time to visit the site referenced to familiarize yourself with how to turn on VoiceOver and some of the basic keystrokes.
  * Unplug your mouse, launch your screen reader, and use some of your favorite sites strictly using the keyboard alone. Why not turn off your screen and depend strictly on the information conveyed by the screen reader?

* Learn About And Use Other OS/Mobile Accessibility Features
  * The [Windows 7 Operating System](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-CA/windows7/products/features/accessibility) has a number of built-in accessibility features, as does the [Mac Operating System](http://www.apple.com/accessibility/macosx/vision.html). [iPhone](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3577), [Android](http://www.google.com/accessibility/products/), and [BlackBerry](http://us.blackberry.com/support/devices/blackberry_accessibility/) devices also have accessibility features. Explore what these are and try them out on the Web. In the case of the mobile devices, try using some of your favorite apps with different accessibility features enabled.
