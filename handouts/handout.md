# Defensive Design

37signals defines defensive design as “design for when things go wrong.”

In their book, Defensive Design for the Web, they define four ways defensive design supports users and helps them recover.

* **Validates** data to check for mistakes before they frustrate the user.
* **Expands** available options based on the user’s implied intent.
* **Protects** site visitors from server errors and broken links with informative messages.
* **Assists** the user before mistakes happen.

# Four Strategies for Simplicity

In his book Simple and Usable, Giles Colborne identifies four strategies for simplicity

* **Remove**. Get rid of unnecessary elements until the product has only the essentials.
* **Organize**. Arrange the elements on the screen so that they make sense.
* **Hide**. Move any elements not essential for mainstream use so that they do not clutter the screen.
* **Displace**. Consider whether any elements or features can be handled offscreen, either in a different part of the site, on a different device, or by users themselves.
