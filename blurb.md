# Open Design Cape Town workshop

This month at CTFEDs we're running a workshop as part of [Open Design Cape Town festival](http://opendesignct.com/). We're going to focus on accessibility, Universal Design, and Human-Centered Design. In particular, we're going to look at making our own stuff more accessible. We'll work through some practical examples and then apply these ideas to our own projects. Please note that this workshop is an iteration on the [Global Accessibility Awareness Day workshop](http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/events/221386799/), but with a big block of coding time in the middle.

That means things like:

* making sure all images have `alt` tags;
* using the new structural HTML5 elements like `section`, `article`, `header`, `footer`, and `nav`;
* using ARIA roles to help guide users through a page, and more.

We'll also going to discuss helping our friends and colleagues learn about accessibility and understand why it's important. We'll put together some ideas for what we can all do at our places of work.

# About the (special) RSVPs

There are only 20 spaces available for this workshop, so we're doing special RSVPs again.

Short version: you'll need to confirm your attendance one week before the workshop.

Longer version: when you RSVP here you'll be added to the Waiting List. One week before the workshop we'll contact you via Meetup, asking for confirmation of your attendance. When you reply to this message, we'll update your RSVP to Yes. If you don't reply to this message, you won't be able to attend the workshop. Eep!
