# Accessibility workshop

This month at CTFEDs we're going to focus on the bottom building block of everything we do: HTML. In particular, we're going to focus on accessibility, just in time for [Global Accessibility Awareness Day](http://www.globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/).

## Your stuff

For the first half of the workshop we're going to look at making our own stuff more accessible. We'll work through some practical examples and then apply the ideas to our own projects.

That means things like:

* making sure all images have `alt` tags;
* using the new stuctural HTML5 elements like `section`, `article`, `header`, `footer`, and `nav`;
* using ARIA roles to help guide users through a page, and more.

## Other people's stuff

For the second half of the workshop we're going to discuss helping our friends and colleagues learn about accessibility and understand why it's important.

We'll put together some ideas for what we can all do at our places of work on Global Accessibility Awareness Day, based on the [GAAD participation activities](http://www.globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/participate.html). Things like going mouseless for an hour, enlarging our default browser font size, and checking for sufficient colour contrast. We'll also talk about how to convince people to take part in these activities!

# About the (special) RSVPs

There are only 20 spaces available for this workshop, so we're doing special RSVPs again.

Short version: you'll need to confirm your attendance one week before the workshop.

Longer version: when you RSVP here you'll be added to the Waiting List. One week before the workshop we'll contact you via meetup, asking for confirmation of your attendance. When you reply to this message, we'll update your RSVP to Yes. If you don't reply to this message, you won't be able to attend the workshop. Eep!
