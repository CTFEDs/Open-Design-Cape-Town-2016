# Workshop outline

We'll all be working on our own stuff, but this isn't a blame game. It's a "how can we make our stuff better for everyone?"" game. It's a love-in. :)

## Warm-up questions

* Who does accessibility help?
* Who will you share the stuff from the workshop with? (tie this in to SMART goal at end)

## Opening activity (as people arrive)

* Share your warm-up answers with your table.
* Review the list of categories of **barriers to access** on the wall. Pick a tick in the column if you know someone who falls into this category.

## Two lightning talks and discussion (15m)

* **Steve**. 5Ws and 1H of Accessibility. Shout outs from audience, but with one in speaker notes?
* **Justin**. WAI-ARIA whistle-stop tour, landmarks, roles, etc. WCAG levels.

## Equations chat (5m)

* Talk through the [Equations](/Global-Accessibility-Awareness-Day-2016/print-for-wall/equations.pdf). Stand around them and audience shout outs. Justin do **Inclusive Design**, Steve do **Disability**.

---

## Personas Tour (20m)

* Use the [personas from A Web For Everyone](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/a-web-for-everyone/personas-for-accessible-ux/).
* Walk around and read the posters of personas on walls.
* Pick a few to focus on. Take a print-out of each. We'll use them later.

---

## Make a checklist (10m)

* Grab two different colour pens: one for FED and one for UX.
* Go through A Web For Everyone's [APPENDIX A: Accessible UX Principles and Guidelines](/Global-Accessibility-Awareness-Day-2016/handouts/AWFE-AppendixA1.pdf).  Mark with a tick items that are FED and items that are UX-related.

## Write down ideas to make them happen (10m)

* As a table, write down some ideas for how to make these things happen. It could be a tool, a process change, a bit of code, a design pattern.
* Have a look at [ctfeds.org/gaadr](http://ctfeds.github.io/Global-Accessibility-Awareness-Day-2016/resources/) for some resources.

## Work on your stuff (90m)

Use the Personas and your checklist to make some changes to some code that you're working on right now.

---

## Inclusive Design at your office (25m)

* Discuss and write down ways to get others at the office to do more Inclusive Design.
  * What's the value?
  * Who does it affect?
* SMART goal setting. Suggest blog post, tweets, share on meetup, Slack groups.

## Facilitator Feedback (5m)

* On an index card, write down **one thing we could do differently next time**.
